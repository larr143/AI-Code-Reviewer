Convention: Your code is missing a module docstring. A module docstring is a special type of comment that provides an overview of the functionality and purpose of the entire module.
 It is important to include a module docstring to help other developers (or yourself) understand the purpose and usage of the module.

length_of_rectangle=10
Error: The constant "length_of_rectangle" should be named in uppercase letters according to Python's naming conventions for constants. Constants are variables whose value should not be changed once defined, and by convention, their names are written in all uppercase letters with underscores separating words.
width_of_rectangle=5
Convention: The constant name "width_of_rectangle" does not follow the recommended naming convention of using uppercase letters and underscores. In Python, constants are typically written in all capital letters with underscores separating words to improve readability and distinguish them from other variable names.
